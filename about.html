            <h1>THE MONDAY IS MINE PODCAST</h1>
            <p>MondayIsMine is a show that was in my brain for way too long (2014 to be exact, #uncstatus), and i finally decided to do it. Soniqrva really put a battery in my back, they challenged me to execute and trust the process. With their help, I could focus on being crative and my best funny self on camera. The content you see each week is the fruit of our labor, and a special gift to the world. Remember, the show doesnt happen without you, so stay tuned for the next episode!</p>
